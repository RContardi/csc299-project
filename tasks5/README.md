# tasks5 — Spec-kit derived task manager

This directory contains the spec-kit generated task manager used for the final project.

What is here
- `.github/` and `.specify/` folders created by the spec-kit workflow.
- The task manager code and supporting files used in development.

Notes
- The repository root contains the canonical `SUMMARY.md` and `video.txt` placeholders; copies of those files are also provided here for packaging convenience.
- The `tasks.db` file is intentionally left alone and currently not committed to the repository (it may be present locally).

How to run
- See the top-level README and each `tasksN` folder's README for instructions.

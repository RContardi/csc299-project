# tasks5 Summary (placeholder)

This file mirrors the project-level `SUMMARY.md` and can be edited to provide a focused summary for the `tasks5` subproject.

- Purpose: tasks manager created from spec-kit experiment.
- How it was created: used GitHub's spec-kit to scaffold an experimental task manager, then copied files into this folder (excluded `.git`).

(Replace this with a detailed account of the `tasks5` development and any agent behaviors.)
